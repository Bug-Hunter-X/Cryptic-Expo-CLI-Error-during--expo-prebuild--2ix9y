This error typically occurs when using Expo's `expo prebuild` command and involves issues with the way Expo resolves dependencies or handles the build process for your project. It is not tied to any specific part of the code, but rather the build configuration or the environment that the build runs in. The error message itself might be cryptic, offering little context, for example a generic error, or might mention something related to `metro` (Expo's bundler) or the build system.  There's no specific code snippet to show as the error is build-related, not code-related.
