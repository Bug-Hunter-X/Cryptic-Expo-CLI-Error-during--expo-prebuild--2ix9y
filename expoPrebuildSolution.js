There is no single solution, since the underlying problem might be different for various cases. The solution often involves a systematic approach to troubleshooting.  For example:

1. **Clean the project:** Delete `node_modules`, and re-install packages using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
2. **Check for Conflicting Dependencies:** Look for any conflicting dependency versions or misconfigurations in the package.json file.
3. **Update Expo CLI:** Run `expo upgrade` to make sure you have the latest Expo CLI version.
4. **Check Node.js and npm versions:** Ensure that Node.js and npm (or yarn) are updated to the latest versions.
5. **Clear Cache:** If on macOS or Linux, consider clearing the cache with commands like `rm -rf $TMPDIR/expo*` and `rm -rf ~/.expo`. 
6. **Examine Full Build Logs:** Carefully go through the complete build logs (you may need to increase the verbosity of the build process to get more logs) to spot any more detailed error messages. These messages will often point to the root cause. 
7. **Create a Minimal Reproducible Example:** If you are unable to isolate the cause, create a very small Expo project that demonstrates the error. This will help diagnose whether the error is with your project's structure or a system-level issue.  
8. **Search for Similar Issues:** Search on the Expo forums and Github for similar error messages or situations. 
9. **Consult the Expo documentation:** The Expo documentation provides details on debugging, build processes, and common issues. 
10. **Restart Your Machine:** Sometimes simply restarting your computer will resolve temporary issues.
